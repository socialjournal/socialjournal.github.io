									<h2>My Philosophy</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Life has no instrinsic meaning or value but even so, I will pursue happiness. It is the whole aim and end of human existence after all as said by Aristotle.
								</p>
								<p>

									I am an optimistic nihilist. I acknowledge that nothing matters. The things I did and will do won't matter. The human race will cease to exist at some point in time and the universe will share the same fate. Yes, it is quite a morbid and depressing but it also freeing. Money, career, school, the things we stress over are nothing. It is okay to not get perfect grades or earn a high salary. In everything, I will prioritize happiness, not only for myself but for other people and for those I care about. I only have one chance at life, might as well make the best of it.

									<h2>My Relationships</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									It is my duty to ensure not only my happiness but also the happiness of those around me. As a family member, I treat my mother and father with respect for all they've done for me. I spend time with them on weekends and try help in any way I can. I do my best at school so that I can support them in the future. As a friend, I try to be an encouraging and humorous companion. I try to keep contact with my old friends and be there when needed. As a citizen, I won't do anything that will affect others negatively such as skipping lines, being a nuisance, littering, etc. I vote for whom I think is best suited and correct others when they are wrong.

									<h2>My Fondest Memories</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									My fondest memories are of when I was a child. I didn't have much problems growing up. Since I was the youngest, I was pampered a little by my parents. This might explain my easygoing attitude. I spent a lot of time indoors since my mom is a tad bit too overprotective. Hence, my introverted personality. I remember my birthdays clearly since they were rather grandiose. There were lots of people and I don't do well with that. That's why I kinda dislike my birthday. My childhood friends were nice, I always played with them after school. We played tag, hide and seek, trade cards, etc. This probably helped with my Initiative vs Guilt stage in Erikson's Theory. All in all, I had a great childhood and couldn't have asked for better.

									<h2>My Influencers</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									As an introvert, having an extrovert mother is both a blessing and curse. The good thing is I learned to deal with people from observing her and it helped with overcoming my shyness. My Father is also an introvert, he assured me that not being good with people is normal and gave me tips in handling difficult situations. I looked up to my big brother who is 10 years older than me sinced it looked like he was good at everything. Dancing, sports, charisma and he had a girlfriend. He was always bringing home food and toys for me after school.

									<h2>The things I learned the hard way</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									During senior high school, since I transferred and knew absolutely no one, I had trouble making friends. I was used to being passive and letting people friend me but this time it was different. Everyone already already had an established group of friends and weren't looking for new ones. So, for the first semester, I had no real close friends. I learned that you need to actually give effort in making friends, not everyone will just approach you.
									I also learned that there are people you just can't get along with. You can't expect everyone to like you and that's okay

									<h2>How I want to be remembered</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I want to be remembered as happy and wise person. Someone who always made the right decision. I want people to think of me as no nonsense person who once you get to know more, is a humorous, fun to be with and delightful person. Someone who is curious, knowledgable and won't stop until he finds the truth.

									<h2>My commitments to be better</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I won't ever assume that I am better than someone. People have different skills they excel at. Just because someone doesn't know something does not mean they are stupid. Everyone you meet knows something you don't. Each person I meet has a life as vivid and complex as my own. Everyone is selfish to an extent and they don't care about you as you think they do.
